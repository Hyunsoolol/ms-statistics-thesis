# Latent Class Model for Mixed Variables with Applications to Text Data  

This repository contains materials related to my master's thesis:  
**"Latent Class Model for Mixed Variables with Applications to Text Data"**  
Published in *The Korea Journal of Applied Statistics*, October 2019.  

## 📌 Abstract  
This study explores a **latent class model** designed for mixed-type variables, with a particular focus on applications in **text data analysis**. The proposed model enhances clustering performance by leveraging a mixture model framework, making it suitable for **unsupervised learning tasks in text mining**.
